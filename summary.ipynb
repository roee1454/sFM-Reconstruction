        "### Why use CUDA?\n",
        "1. **Performance Boost**: Feature extraction and matching can be **10x to 100x faster** on a GPU compared to a multi-core CPU.\n",
        "2. **Point Density**: Because GPU matching is faster, you can afford to use higher `max_image_size` and `max_num_features` (e.g., 8000+ features). This leads to a significantly **more dense and detailed final point cloud**.\n",
        "3. **Real-time processing**: For large datasets (100+ images), CPU-only reconstruction can take hours, whereas GPU-accelerated pipelines can finish in minutes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How to Enable\n",
